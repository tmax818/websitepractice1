    <p>HTML uses tags to identify page content. This text is a **paragraph.**</p>


    <p>We can trace HTML's history all the way back to 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee published a document called HTML tags. Which described a set of tags that could be used to mark up contents of online documents. Now this eventually led to <strong>the publication of </strong>the first HTML specification which was HTML 2.0., in 1995, HTML 3.2 followed in 1997. Only to be replaced by HTML 4.0 later in the same year. So those early years, saw a lot of <i>specifications</i> being developed and parallel to each other and released right around the same time.</p>
